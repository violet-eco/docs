We invite you to join us on this journey as we explore the choices that have shaped the direction of Violet\'s development.\\n\\n## The Transition\\n\\nOur embrace of closed source is not a destination but rather a strategic channel that\\nstrengthens our base. This strategy enables us to establish a strong foundation before\\nwelcoming the outside world. We can promise you that this journey is not about closing\\noff possibilities but preparing the path for future exploration. It\'s not a barrier; a\\nloving shield to preserve the brilliance that defines Violet.\\n\\n## Illuminating the Path\\n\\nOur beliefs remain centered on transparency and we value building sincere relationships\\nwith Violetians. We want to be sincere about the closed source nature of Violet, even\\nthough some components of Violet are open-sourced. However, let this not cast a shadow\\nthat makes it harder for us to see!\\n\\nWe see the transition to closed source at this critical time as a bridge that connects\\nour past and our future. It acts as a transition point between now and past Violet - more\\ndeveloped, safe and feature-rich.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\nWe invite you to join us on this exciting path forward. Your insights and cooperation\\nwill continue to be invaluable as we continue to improve Violet and investigate new\\npossibilities. Together, we shall keep pushing the limits of what an operating system is\\ncapable of.\\n\\nWe appreciate your participation in the Violet saga and are looking forward to an amazing future.\\n\\nHappy Violeting! \u2728\ud83d\udc9c\\n\\nThe Violet Team"},{"id":"unveiling-violet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/unveiling-violet","editUrl":"https://github.com/violet-eco/docs/tree/main/docs/blog/2023-07-23-unveiling-violet.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-23-unveiling-violet.md","title":"Unveiling Violet: A Next-Generation Operating System","description":"Hey there, fellow Violetians!","date":"2023-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 23, 2023","tags":[{"label":"violet","permalink":"/blog/tags/violet"}],"readingTime":2.52,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"G\xfclce","title":"Maintainer of Violet","url":"https://github.com/gulje","imageURL":"https://github.com/gulje.png","key":"gulce"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"unveiling-violet","title":"Unveiling Violet: A Next-Generation Operating System","authors":["gulce"],"tags":["violet"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Understanding the Spectrum of Open Source and Closed Source in Violet","permalink":"/blog/open-and-closed-source-in-violet"}},"content":"*Hey there, fellow Violetians!*\\n\\nToday, I\'m thrilled to take you on an exciting journey to unveil the wonders of Violet, a next-generation operating system that aims to redefine the way we interact with technology.
