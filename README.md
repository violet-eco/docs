# Violet
Violet is a modern experimental operating system that
aims to provide the highest security to its users.

## Features

### Immutable System
Violet follows an immutable system model, where the core components
of the operating system remain unchanged throughout its lifetime. This
approach enhances stabilitiy and provides a consistent user experience.
System integrity is maintained by monitoring critical files' hashes and
performing automatic recovery if lampering is detected.

### Extreme Customization
Violet offers extreme customization options. It allows users to personalize
their computing experience to the fullest extent. Users can customize the
desktop environment.

### Crash Saves
Violet incorporates a crash saves feature to safeguard user data in the event of system
crashes or unexpected shutdowns. Crash saves automatically capture the state of running
applications, allowing users to restore their work to the point just before the crash
occurred. This feature provides peace of mind and helps users recover quickly from
unexpected interruptions.

### Multi-Platform Support
Violet aims for broad compatibility and can run on multiple platforms, including
Linux, Windows and macOS systems. The Vioelt Calls Wrapper faciliates running
Violet applications natively on these platforms, although some features may be
limited compared to the native Violet environment.
