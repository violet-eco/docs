## Discovering Applications

The store offers a rich catalog of applications across different categories. Users can
browse through these categories to discover new applications or use the search functionality to find specific apps by name or keywords.

## Application Listings

Each application in the store has its own listing page that provides detailed information
about the app. The listing includes the application's name, developer information,
description, screenshots, user reviews, ratings, and other relevant details.

Users can read the description and view screenshots to get a better understanding of the
application's features and functionality. They can also check the user reviews and
ratings to gauge the overall quality and user satisfaction of the app.

## Installation and Updates

Installing applications from the Violet Store is a seamless process. Users can click on
the "Install" button on the application listing page, and the store will handle the
download and installation automatically. The installation progress is displayed to the
user.

Once an application is installed, the store ensures that it stays up to date. It
automatically checks for updates to installed applications and notifies the user when new
updates are available. Users can choose to update their applications with a single click.

### Installation Methods

Applications in the Violet Store can be installed using different methods.

#### Standard Installation

The standard installation method allows users to install applications from the Violet
Store with a simple click. The application will be downloaded and installed automatically, making it ready to use.

#### Volatile Installation

Violet introduces a unique installation method called volatile installation for certain
applications in the Violet Store. Volatile applications provide a lightweight and
transient experience by running directly from their package files, without being
permanently installed on the device.

**Note:** Not all applications in the Violet Store support volatile installation. The
availability of volatile installation depends on the application developer's choices and
the nature of the application.
