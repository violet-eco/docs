# Dahlia

Dahlia is the toolchain required to build Violet applications.

## Description

Dahlia is made of several tools:

- A *builder*, which builds application packages from their manifest
- A *publisher*, which allows to sign the application and upload it to the Store

It relies on several external compilers (Rust, ...) to build
applications from source.
