# Fern
Fern is a text-based desktop environment designed for serves and as a
fallback option when no graphical output is available or when the primary desktop
environment is inaccessible.

Fern operates entirely in a text-based mode, with all graphical elements disabled.
Graphical applications cannot be launched. This promotes a stable and crash-free
environment.

Applications can only be launched through commands. It ensures controlled execution
and minimizes the risk of crashes.
