# Development

[Rust&trade;](https://rust-lang.org) is the main programming language used for the entire Violet ecosystem. A contemporary and secure programming environment with an emphasis on memory safety, concurrency and speed is offered by Rust. It has a strong type system, strict borrowing rules and built-in multithreading support.

In Violet, the usage of architecture-specific Assembly language is reduced and restricted
to few situations when it is required to accomplish desired behaviour or enhance
performance in crucial system components.
