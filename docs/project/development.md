# Development

The Violet project is primarily developed in [Rust&trade;](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Rust provides a modern and safe development environment with a focus on memory safety,
concurrency and performance. It offers a powerful type system, strict borrowing rules
and built-in support for multithreading.

The use of architecture-specific Assembly language in the Violet project is minimized and
limited to specific cases where it is necessary to achieve targeted behavior or optimize
performance in critical sections of the system.
