# Multi-Platform Management

Violet offers a unique multi-platform management solution that allows the Violet
ecosystem programs to run on Linux, Windows or macOS systems. This is made possible
through a special wrapper called *Violet Calls Wrapper*, which can be easily downloaded
from Violet's website.

## Integration on Different Platforms

With Violet Calls Wrapper, you can run Violet apps natively on your preferred operating system. It doesn't matter whether it is Linux, Windows or macOS.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with multi-platform management in Violet, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit the official Violet website and go to Downloads.
2. Look for the Violet Calls Wrapper download option and select the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. After the package is downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

## Running Violet Applications

To run Violet apps on your chosen platform using Violet Calls Wrapper, follow these steps:

1. Find the Violet application package (usually in .vap format) that you want to run on your system.
2. Double click the application package or use the command line interface to execute the application using Violet Calls Wrapper.
3. Violet Calls Wrapper will do the necessary translations and compatibility adjustments to ensure that the Violet app runs smoothly on your platform.
4. Enjoy the full functionality of the Violet app, including its features and capabilities, directly on your system.

## Considerations and Limitations

It is important to note that although Violet Calls Wrapper allows running Violet
applications on different platforms, certain limitations and considerations exist:

1. **Permission Management:** Violet Calls Wrapper may not fully replicate Violet's permission management features across all platforms.
2. **Native Violet Apps:** Violet Calls Wrapper provides compatibility for Violet ecosystem programs, but may not provide access to native Violet apps. This means that certain features, such as Violet desktop, may not be accessible when running the apps through the wrapper.
3. **Platform-Specific Limitations:** Each operating system has its own limitations and considerations. While Violet Calls Wrapper aims to provide a seamless experience, it may encounter platform-specific issues or restrictions that may affect the performance or functionality of Violet apps.
