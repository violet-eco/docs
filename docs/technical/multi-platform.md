# Multi-platform management
Violet ecosystem programs can be run on Linux, Windows,
or macOS systems using a wrapper called the *Violet Calls Wrapper*.
It can be downloaded from Violet's website.

When installed on a system, it serves to run Violet applications natively,
although the permission management does not work perfectly and some features
cannot be implemented (e.g. no desktop, no access to native Violet applications -
only native libraries etc.)
