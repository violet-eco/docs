# Welcome!

![Banner](https://github.com/violet-eco/docs/blob/main/brand/banner.png?raw=true)

Dear Violetian, welcome to the documentation of Violet! These documents serve as a
comprehensive guide to understand the inner workings of Violet, its features and its
potential. Whether you are a developer, an enthusiast or simply curious about Violet,
this documentation will provide valuable insights into the project.

Now, let's get real for a moment. Violet is a project by a single person (me truly), so
while I've poured my heart and soul into it, there may be a few quirks or hiccups along
the way. If you spot any bugs, glitches or have ideas for improvement, please don't hold
back—your feedback is invaluable!

Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure with Violet.
Let's unlock the full potential of your digital world.

## What is Violet?

Violet is an advanced operating system that redefines the computing experience by merging
cutting-edge technologies, privacy-focused features and smooth user interactions. Violet
is a next-generation computing environment that allows Violetians to explore the digital
world with confidence and comfort; developed with a strong emphasis on security,
performance and user-centric design.

It is based on the Rust at its heart, which provides a modern and secure basis for the
whole ecosystem. Rust supports Violet's strong performance by focusing on memory safety,
concurrency and speed.

Imagine an operating system that combines the best features of macOS, Linux and
Windows, while pushing the boundaries of performance, security and customization.
That's exactly what Violet aims to achieve.

### Components

Violet's architecture is designed with modularity, performance and flexibility in mind. It consists of several key components that work together harmoniously to create an efficient operating system.

#### Kernel (Nova)

> Refer to [this document](./specs/kernel/README.md).

At the heart of Violet lies the microkernel named *Nova*. The kernel provides the
foundation for all system applications and facilitates communication between the hardware
and software layers. It ensures the efficient utilization of system resources, enforces
security measures, manages processes and memory.

#### System

The system encompasses all the essential system-level functionalities and services that
enable the smooth operation of Violet. This includes the management of user accounts,
permissions, file systems, networking, security and system configurations. The system
component acts as the intermediary between the kernel and the user-facing applications,
ensuring proper coordination and execution of system-level tasks.

#### Desktop Environment

> Refer to [this document](./applications/aurora.md).

The desktop environment in Violet, known as *Aurora*, provides the user interface for
interacting with the operating system and its applications. It encompasses the graphical
elements, window management, application launchers, taskbars and other visual components
that make up the user experience. Aurora offers a modern, intuitive and customizable
interface, allowing users to personalize their desktop, switch between applications, and
access system features efficiently.
