## Will this project replace Windows/macOS/Linux/... one day?

No, it's impossible. Because ignoring backward compatibility
for legacy architectures and already existing software is
simply not viable for an operating system. Users first
look at applications in an operating system, **then** the system
itself - for security, stability, performance, etc.

Imagine that someone offers you a great operating system, but
there are almost no applications in it. Would you still use
this OS instead of Windows/macOS/Linux? Of course no!

That's why this project is **purely theoretical**.

## How can I help?

Help is very welcome but there's not many things to help with currently,
as the system is still being designed. You can still help by suggesting
improvements or fixing an error (whatever it is, a design problem or a simple typo)
by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/violet-eco/docs/issues/new/choose).
