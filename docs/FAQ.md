## Project-related

### Will this project replace Windows/macOS/Linux/... one day?

No, it's impossible. Because ignoring backward compatibility
for legacy architectures and already existing software is
simply not viable for an operating system. Users first
look at applications in an operating system, **then** the system
itself - for security, stability, performance, etc.

Imagine that someone offers you a great operating system, but
there are almost no applications in it. Would you still use
this OS instead of Windows/macOS/Linux? Of course no!

That's why this project is **purely theoretical**.

### What are the hardware requirements for Violet?

Please refer to [this document](project/hardware-requirements.md).

### Can I use Violet on older hardware?

Violet's system requirements may vary, but it is optimized for modern
hardware configurations. Running Violet on older hardware may result in
reduced performance or compatibility issues.

### Does Violet have a built-in software update mechanism?

Yes, Violet includes an automatic software update mechanism that keeps the operating
system and installed applications up to date with the latest bug fixes, security patches,
and new features.

## Privacy and security-related

### How does Violet protect my privacy?

Violet prioritizes user privacy and implements various measures to safeguard personal
data. It incorporates features like data encryption, user consent controls, and data
minimization practices to ensure privacy protection.

### Can I control the data that applications collect in Violet?

Yes, Violet provides data collection controls that allow users to manage and control the
data collected by applications. Through the Privacy Dashboard, users can specify the
types of data that applications can access and grant or revoke permissions accordingly.

### How does Violet handle secure storage of sensitive information?

Violet employs secure storage mechanisms to protect sensitive user information. It utilizes encryption algorithms and secure key management practices to ensure that data stored on the system remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

### Can Violet detect and mitigate security threats?

Yes, Violet incorporates advanced security features and employs robust security protocols
to detect and mitigate security threats. It includes features like secure boot
verification, system-wide monitoring, and regular security updates to proactively address
potential vulnerabilities.

### Does Violet have a password management feature?

Yes, Violet includes a built-in password management feature that allows users to securely
store and manage their passwords. It offers features like password generation,
encryption, and synchronization across devices for enhanced password security.

### How does Violet handle software updates to ensure security?

Violet employs a secure software update mechanism that regularly delivers updates to the
operating system and installed applications. These updates include bug fixes, security
patches, and performance enhancements to keep the system secure and up to date.

### Does Violet provide a secure remote wipe feature?

Yes, Violet includes a secure remote wipe feature that allows users to remotely erase
their device's data in case of loss or theft. This ensures that personal information
remains protected and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals.

### How does Violet handle data backups and recovery?

Violet offers data backup and recovery options to protect against data loss. Users can
schedule regular backups and store them securely, allowing for easy data recovery in case
of accidental deletion or system failure.

### What does an immutable system mean in Violet?

In Violet, an immutable system refers to the core principle of maintaining the integrity
and security of the operating system by making it read-only or unchangeable. This means
that the system files, configurations, and critical components are protected and cannot
be modified, tampered with, or altered by users or malicious software. The immutability
of the system helps to prevent unauthorized changes, enhance stability, and reduce the
risk of security vulnerabilities.

## How can I help?

Help is very welcome but there's not many things to help with currently,
as the system is still being designed. You can still help by suggesting
improvements or fixing an error (whatever it is, a design problem or a simple typo)
by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/violet-eco/docs/issues/new/choose).
