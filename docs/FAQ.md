# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What's the deal with Violet?

Violet is the *coolest* new operating system in town! It's all about giving you a
one-of-a-kind computing experience with some futuristic features like mood detection, automatic file organization and an emotional interface.

## Will Violet work on my old device?

Violet comes with some pretty heavy-duty features that might be a bit too much for older
computers to handle. Running Violet on older hardware may result in reduced performance or compatibility issues.

## Why Rust?

Rust was chosen as the primary programming language for Violet due to its emphasis on memory safety, concurrency and performance. Its strong type system and strict borrowing rules help prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities, making it an ideal choice for building a secure and reliable operating system.

## What's the current state of Violet?

Violet is currently in its very early stages. You can follow its progress on our
[blog posts](https://violet-eco.github.io/blog/),
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/violet-eco/) and [Roadmap](./project/roadmap.md)
document.

## Will this project replace Windows, macOS, Linux, ... one day?

While Violet is a next-generation operating system with cutting-edge features, it's essential to acknowledge that replacing established operating systems like Windows, macOS or Linux is a massive challenge. Maintaining compatibility with existing software and supporting legacy architectures is crucial for users.

Imagine having a fantastic operating system but missing out your favourite apps and tools
that you rely on daily. It's a deal-breaker for must users and we totally get it! ðŸ˜…

## How does Violet protect my privacy?

Violet prioritizes user privacy and implements various measures to safeguard personal
data. It incorporates features like data encryption, user consent controls, and data
minimization practices to ensure privacy protection.

## How can I help?

Help is very welcome but there's not many things to help with currently,
as the system is still being designed. You can still help by suggesting
improvements or fixing an error (whatever it is, a design problem or a simple typo)
by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/violet-eco/violet-eco.github.io/issues/new/choose).
Your contributions are valuable and greatly appreciated!
