Violet, as a next-generation operating system, embraces the exciting realm of
quantum mechanics and allows developers to realize quantum computing's potential.

## Quantum Mechanics Primer

Quantum mechanics is the basis of quantum computing, and a good understanding of its
concepts is **required** to use Violet's QCI efficiently. We present an in-depth
introduction on quantum mechanics in this section.

### Superposition and Quantum States

> [Click for further details](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition)

Superposition is one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. Unlike
classical bits, which can only be 0 or zero states, quantum bits, or **qubits**, can
exist in several states at the same time. This enables quantum computers to do several
calculations concurrently.

Violet's QCI uses the Dirac notation to express quantum states. A qubit's state is
represented by a ket vector $\psi‚ü©$, where $\psi$ represents a linear combination of
basis states, typically $|0\rang$ and $|1\rang$. Mathematically, a qubit in superposition
can be expressed as:

$|\psi\rang = \alpha|0\rang + \beta|1\rang$

Here, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex values, known as *probability amplitudes*, and
their squares determine the probabilities of observing the qubit in state $|0\rang$ or
$1\rang$ upon measurement.

### Quantum Measurements

Measurements are fundamentally probabilistic in the quantum world. When a quantum system
is measured, it collapses from a state of superposition to a definite state. However, the
measurement's outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

In quantum mechanics, the measuring process is represented by the
[**Born rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule), which correlates probabilities
with the various results of the measurement. For a qubit $\psi\rang$ in superposition,
the probability of observing it in state $|0\rang$ upon measurement is given by
$|\alpha|^2$, and the probability of observing it in state $1\rang$ is given by
$|\beta|^2$.

### Uncertainty Principle

[**Heisenberg's uncertainty principle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)
is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that limits the accuracy with which some
complementary properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously measured.
For example, if we try to measure a quantum particle's location with great accuracy, its
momentum becomes uncertain, and vice versa.

## Quantum Gates and Unitary Transformations

[**Quantum gates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate) are fundamental
building blocks in quantum circuits that perform operations on qubits. Quantum gates,
like logic gates (such as AND, OR, NOT), manipulate the quantum state of qubits.

- **Hadamard Gate (H):** It is a common quantum gate that is essential in many quantum algorithms, such as the quantum Fourier transform and quantum superposition creation. The Hadamard gate converts a qubit into an equal superposition of $|0\rang$ and $|1\rang$ states, as represented by the matrix:

$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
    1 && 1 \\
    1 && -1
\end{bmatrix}$

- **CNOT gate (Controlled-NOT):** It operates on two qubits. It flips the target (second) qubit if only if the control (first) qubit is in the state $|1\rang$. It has the following matrix representation:

$CNOT = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 && 0 && 0 && 0 \\
    0 && 1 && 0 && 0 \\
    0 && 0 && 0 && 1 \\
    0 && 0 && 1 && 0
\end{bmatrix}$

We can create quantum circuits that perform complex calculations and transformations on
qubits by combining multiple gates.

### Quantum Entanglement

One of the most fascinating things in quantum mechanics is
[**quantum entanglement**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement). When two
or more qubits become entangled, their quantum states become linked regardless of their
distance.

### Bell States

[**Bell States**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state) are a set of four
maximally entangled two-qubit states. The following are the four Bell States:

1. $|\Phi^+\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rang_A \otimes |0\rang_B + |1\rang_A \otimes |1\rang_B)$
2. $|\Phi^-\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rang_A \otimes |0\rang_B - |1\rang_A \otimes |1\rang_B)$
3. $|\Psi^+\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rang_A \otimes |1\rang_B + |1\rang_A \otimes |0\rang_B)$
4. $|\Psi^-\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rang_A \otimes |1\rang_B - |1\rang_A \otimes |0\rang_B)$

## Quantum Error Correction

Due to the inherent susceptibility of quantum systems to noise and decoherence,
[**quantum error correction (QEC)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction)
is really critical. Qubits, unlike traditional bits, are extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances and interactions with surrounding particles. This sensitivity
can cause errors in quantum computing.

Quantum decoherence occurs when quantum information contained in qubits interacts with
environment, it results in the loss of quantum coherence and errors. Thermal
fluctuations, electromagnetic radiation and other interactions with surrounding particles
all contribute to this occurrence.

Without proper error correction mechanisms, quantum algorithms become vulnerable to
errors. The effects of quantum decoherence gets more obvious as quantum computers scale
up and grow more complicated.
