# Biometric Authorization

A cutting-edge security feature called biometric authentication enables Violetians to
access their devices and applications using distinctive physical or behavioural features.
Violet uses biometric technologies to give users a convenient and secure authentication
that keeps their private information safe.

## Introduction

Passwords and PINs are two classic authentication mechanisms that have long been used to
protect user accounts and devices. These techniques, however, have a number of
shortcomings, such as a susceptibility to brute-force assaults and the requirement to
remember complicated passwords.

By utilizing distinctive biometric characteristics that are nearly impossible to
duplicate or fake, biometric authentication addresses these problems. Modern
authentication systems frequently employ the following biometric traits.

1. **Fingerprint Recognition:** identifying users by scanning and comparing their distinctive fingerprint patterns.

2. **Facial Recognition:** analyzing facial traits and comparing them to a pre-registered face template for authentication.

3. **Iris or Retinal Scanning:** Capturing specific patterns in the iris or retina to identify the user.

## Enrollment Process

Violetians can register their biometric characteristics with Violet during the
registration procedure. For instance, they can record their voice, scan their
fingerprint, or take a picture of their face. The device stores the biometric information
securely and encrypts it to prevent unauthorized users from accessing it or altering it.

## Authentication Process

The biometric authentication procedure is started when an user tries to sign in to Violet
or access a particular application. A prompt asks the user to enter their biometric
characteristic, such as resting their finger on a fingerprint sensor or gazing into the
front-facing camera for facial recognition.

The acquired biometric information is then compared to the previously saved biometric
templates. Violet's algorithms carry out a quick and accurate comparison,
guaranteeing a seamless authentication procedure. The user is given access if the
acquired data matches any of the registered biometric templates within a set threshold of
similarity. Otherwise, entry is prohibited.
