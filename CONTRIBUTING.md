### Commit Message Header

  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.

  └─⫸ Commit Type: add|build|ci|fix|improve|typo
```

The `<type>` and `<short summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- `add`: Adding new documentation file or folder
- `build`: Changes that affect the book build system
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files
- `fix`: Fixing errors in documentation files (e.g. broken link)
- `improve`: Change that adds information to existing documentation files
- `typo`: A typo fix

#### Scope

The scope should be the name of the subdirectory. 

The following is the list of supported scopes:

- `concepts`
- `features`
- `project`
- `specs`

#### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

The body can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations. For example:

```
or
```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
```

### Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain reference to GitHub issues and other PRs that this commit
closes or is related to. For example:

```
Fixes #<issue number>
```
or
```
Closes #<pr number>
```
