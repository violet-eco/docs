</ol>
<h3 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h3>
<p>Violet's architecture is designed with modularity, performance and flexibility in mind. It consists of several key components that work together harmoniously to create an efficient operating system.</p>
<h4 id="kernel-sakura"><a class="header" href="#kernel-sakura">Kernel (Sakura)</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer to <a href="./specs/kernel/README.html">this document</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the heart of Violet lies the microkernel named <em>Sakura</em>. The kernel provides the foundation for all system applications and facilitates communication between the hardware and software layers. It ensures the efficient utilization of system resources, enforces security measures, manages processes and memory.</p>
<h4 id="system"><a class="header" href="#system">System</a></h4>
<p>The system encompasses all the essential system-level functionalities and services that
enable the smooth operation of Violet. This includes the management of user accounts,
permissions, file systems, networking, security and system configurations. The system
component acts as the intermediary between the kernel and the user-facing applications,
ensuring proper coordination and execution of system-level tasks.</p>
<h4 id="desktop-environment"><a class="header" href="#desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Refer to <a href="./applications/lotus.html">this document</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The desktop environment in Violet, known as <em>Lotus</em>, provides the user interface for
interacting with the operating system and its applications. It encompasses the graphical
elements, window management, application launchers, taskbars and other visual components
that make up the user experience. Lotus offers a modern, intuitive and customizable
interface, allowing users to personalize their desktop, switch between applications, and
access system features efficiently.</p>

<p>No, it's impossible. Because ignoring backward compatibility
for legacy architectures and already existing software is
simply not viable for an operating system. Users first
look at applications in an operating system, <strong>then</strong> the system
itself - for security, stability, performance, etc.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone offers you a great operating system, but
there are almost no applications in it. Would you still use
this OS instead of Windows/macOS/Linux? Of course no!</p>
<p>That's why this project is <strong>purely theoretical</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="phase-1-conception---current-stage"><a class="header" href="#phase-1-conception---current-stage">Phase 1: Conception &lt;- current stage</a></h2>
<p>The conception phase of Violet project involves documenting and conceptualizing how the
system will work at both high-level and low-level aspects. This phase focuses on defining
the system's concepts, features, native applications, as well as the design and
management of processes and the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2-validation"><a class="header" href="#phase-2-validation">Phase 2: Validation</a></h2>
<p>The validation phase of Violet involves reviewing and validating the conception documents
that were created during the previous phase. The purpose of the validation phase is to
ensure that the conceived system design is comprehensive, coherent, and aligned with the
project's goals.</p>
<p>During the validation phase, each conception document will be thoroughly reviewed,
analyzed, and evaluated. The validation process aims to identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or potential issues in the system design.</p>
<p>Once a conception document has been validated, it will be considered as a foundation for
the development process and will serve as a reference for subsequent implementation
phases. While breaking changes after validation are still possible, they should be
avoided as much as possible to maintain stability and consistency in the system design.</p>
<p>The validation phase ensures that the conceived system design meets the project's
requirements, aligns with the project's goals, and provides a solid basis for the
subsequent development and implementation stages.</p>

<h2 id="how-applications-work"><a class="header" href="#how-applications-work">How applications work?</a></h2>
<p>An application consists of executable files and associated resources. In Violet, binary
programs are not directly supported, so applications serve as the intermediary layer to
run code. When an application is launched, it is loaded into memory and its code is
executed by the system.</p>
<h2 id="installation-methods"><a class="header" href="#installation-methods">Installation Methods</a></h2>
<p>Applications in Violet are installed through application packages. There are several installation methods available:</p>
<h3 id="from-the-store"><a class="header" href="#from-the-store">From the store</a></h3>
<p>Applications can be downloaded and installed from the official Violet store. The store
provides a centralized platform for users to discover and install applications. For
closed-source applications, the store offers precompiled programs. For open-source
applications, the store supports both precompiled programs and source code compilation.</p>
<h3 id="sideloading"><a class="header" href="#sideloading">Sideloading</a></h3>
<p>Sideloading refers to the installation of an application directly from its package without going through the official store. Violet offers different sideloading modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable mode:</strong> Sideloading is completely blocked, and applications can only be installed from the store. Volatile applications can still be run.</li>
<li><strong>Safe mode:</strong> Sideloading is allowed, but the system performs security checks. It verifies if the application's AID (Application ID) matches an application available in the store. It also compares the signature of the application with the signature of the store application. If the AID or the signatures do not match, the application is considered malicious and will not be installed. Note that this mode requires an internet connection to check against the store.</li>
<li><strong>Insecure mode:</strong> Sideloading is allowed without any security checks. This mode is considered less secure, as it allows for potential spoofing or installation of untrusted applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can switch between sideloading modes in the Settings, depending on their desired
level of security and control over application installation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, sideloading is disabled in Violet for security reasons. Users can
enable sideloading in the system settings, but it is recommended to exercise caution and
only install applications from trusted sources.</p>
<h3 id="volatile-applications"><a class="header" href="#volatile-applications">Volatile applications</a></h3>
<p><em>Volatile applications</em> offer an alternative way to run applications without installing
them to disk permanently. Violet provides different modes for running volatile
applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-volatile:</strong> All data associated with the application is deleted once the application is closed.</li>
<li><strong>Session-scoped:</strong> The application's data is kept on disk until the system is shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Local-persistent:</strong> The application's data is stored in a data file with the extension `*.vad`` (Volatile Application Data) created in the same folder as the application package.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent:</strong> The application's data is stored in a dedicated folder, allowing for persistent storage across multiple sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, volatile applications run in local-persistent mode. In this mode, the system
searches for a file with the same name as the application's package file but with the
<code>*.vad</code> extension. If the file is found, it serves as the application's storage, and any
data the application wants to store is written to this file.</p>
<p>Persistently running volatile applications are not listed in the application list and can
only be managed through an option in the Settings. While their data is stored on
disk, their executables are not stored separately but reside within the application
package. This allows running the same application multiple times without worrying about
data conflicts. Additionally, it supports shared data storage between users.</p>
<p>Violet Store provides an option to install applications as volatile.</p>
<h2 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h2>
<p>Applications in Violet can provide shell commands, allowing users to interact with the
application's functionality from the command line. To prevent conflicts between command
names, application commands are prefixed with the AID (Application ID) using dots instead
of two colons. This approach ensures unique command names for each application and avoids
naming conflicts.</p>
<p>For example, if an application with the AID <code>developer::app</code> provides the command
<code>get_time</code>, the full command name would be <code>developer.app.get_time</code>. However, in shell
prompts (not scripts), if no other application provides a command with the same name, the
short form <code>get_time</code> can be used directly.</p>
<p>Commands in Violet work by executing the application within a specific execution context.</p>
<h2 id="system-applications"><a class="header" href="#system-applications">System Applications</a></h2>
<p>Some applications are part of the system itself and are known as system applications.
These applications have special privileges and access to system-reserved features. System
applications also have the ability to create system services, which are processes that
run at startup with system permissions.</p>
<p>System applications <strong>CANNOT BE UNINSTALLED</strong> as they are critical to the proper functioning
of the system. Non-system native applications, however, can be uninstalled if desired.</p>
<p>Some native applications are part of the system itself and
are called <em>system applications</em>. These applications have some special privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to system-reserved features</li>
<li>Permission to create <em>system service</em></li>
<li>They cannot be uninstalled</li>
</ul>
<p>System applications cannot be removed <em>by any means</em> as
they are critical to the correct functioning of the system.
Native applications which are not system applications can be removed, though.</p>
<h2 id="services"><a class="header" href="#services">Services</a></h2>
<p>Applications can create <em>services</em> by specifying them in their manifests.
The services will run at startup with the application's permissions.</p>
<p>There is exactly one process for each service per active user.</p>

<h2 id="how-libraries-work"><a class="header" href="#how-libraries-work">How libraries work?</a></h2>
<p>Unlike applications, libraries can be installed in multiple
versions. This means you can have three versions of the same
library installed at the same time on your computer.</p>
<p>When an application wants to use a library, it explicitly indicates
the list of versions it is compatible with. The system gets the related
version and provides it to the application.</p>
<p>A library by itself cannot do itself; no background process, no commands
exposure, no permission granting. Applications simply use libraries as
helpers to achieve specific tasks.</p>

<h2 id="the-concept"><a class="header" href="#the-concept">The concept</a></h2>
<p>Most computers are intended to be shared among many people.
In such a situation it is quite useful to separate each user's
data from each other and restrict access to the other.</p>
<p>By default, there are two user accounts: the <em>System</em> and the <em>Administrator</em>.
They are called <em>virtual users</em> because it is not possible to log in these accounts.
Other users are called <em>custom users</em>.</p>
<p>Each custom user has a data folder called <em>home directory</em> designated as <code>/home/[username]</code>.
Users can access the files and folders inside this folder and do whatever they want.
By default, each user has access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its home directory in <code>/home/[username]</code></li>
<li>The mounted units in <code>/media</code></li>
<li>Its temporary directory in <code>/tmp/[username]</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="users-type"><a class="header" href="#users-type">Users type</a></h2>
<p>Each user is in one of these types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phantom:</strong> all data of the user is deleted after the computer is turned off</li>
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> nothing special</li>
<li><strong>Administrator:</strong> can run programs directly as administrator</li>
<li><strong>Main administrator:</strong> administrator account that can manage storage encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user wants to perform a task for which he is not authorized,
it may want to run the task as another user. The other user's login
informations are required then.</p>
<p>A task cannot be performed as system or administrator because these
accounts are virtual and have no passwords, <strong>except</strong> if an administrator
user tries to run a task as administrator.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is always only one and exactly one administrator.
This account is created during the installation process and can later be transferred
to another administrator account.</p>
<h2 id="dangers-of-an-administrator-account"><a class="header" href="#dangers-of-an-administrator-account">Dangers of an administrator account</a></h2>
<p>The problem with the administrator account is that <strong>it can do anything</strong> (except
some very specific things). They can change system settings, read and modify other users'
data, and even run background processes on startup.
They also have all possible permissions.</p>
<p>Having two administrator accounts on one computer is <strong>definitely</strong> not
recommended unless both accounts are used by trusted people. For this reason,
a large warning is shown when you try to create a new administrator account.</p>
<h2 id="user-privileges-elevation-upe"><a class="header" href="#user-privileges-elevation-upe">User Privileges Elevation (UPE)</a></h2>
<p>Users can request permission to run a task as another user, such as running as administrator.</p>
<p>In such a case, the program is still run as the same user, but with the same user's
privileges and the user's privileges specified to the UPE.</p>
<p>To run a program with UPE, either knowing the user's password or <em>authorization</em>
from this user is required. For example, administrator accounts are <em>authorized</em>
to use the Administrator account without specifying a password.</p>
<p>Successful or not, every request is logged in the log file at <code>/etc/logs/auc</code>.</p>
<h2 id="groups"><a class="header" href="#groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>Groups are a set of privileges defined by the administrator. Access some folders or application's permissions (e.g. microphone access) can be restricted to a specific group, for instance. When a user is created, it can be put in a group. It then automatically inherits all of the group's privileges, in addition to its own ones. The administrator can add and remove users from groups with the control panel.</p>
<p>When a user is in a group, the group's privileges cannot be revoked for this user.</p>

<h2 id="signal-and-response-mechanism"><a class="header" href="#signal-and-response-mechanism">Signal and Response Mechanism</a></h2>
<p>Violet periodically notifies all running programs, with a default interval of one minute,
at a configurable time interval. The applications are prompted by this signal to respond
with the information required to maintain their current condition.</p>
<p>The crash save signal has three possible responses from applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide crash save information:</strong> Applications can reply by supplying all the necessary data to enable state restoration. This entails maintaining user information, application settings, information about currently active sessions, and any other crucial data needed for a thorough recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Declining the current collect:</strong> Applications have the option to deny delivering crash save information while the signal is being collected. After a specific amount of time, the signal will be transmitted to the application once more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refuse crash saves:</strong> Applications have the option of sending a message stating that they will not offer any crash saves while the current instance of the application is operating. Since the application explicitly chooses not to participate in the gathering of crash save data, the signal will not be transmitted to the application's instance once more in this scenario.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Crash save signals are terminated for certain applications if they are not responded to
by the program in question. The succeeding signals, however, will keep getting
transmitted to other open applications.</p>
<h2 id="integrity-and-security"><a class="header" href="#integrity-and-security">Integrity and Security</a></h2>
<p>Violet uses an integrity checker named <a href="features/../technical/integrity.html">Eden</a>
(<a href="https://github.com(violet-eco/eden)">GitHub</a> to make sure that crash save data is
reliable and legitimate. For the purpose of preventing any possible tampering with or

<h3 id="frequency-scaling-policies"><a class="header" href="#frequency-scaling-policies">Frequency Scaling Policies</a></h3>
<p>Violet employs frequency scaling policies that define the relationship between CPU
utilization and clock speed. These policies determine how the CPU frequency is adjusted
based on the observed workload. Different policies can be implemented depending on the
desired balance between power efficiency and performance.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-decision"><a class="header" href="#scaling-decision">Scaling Decision</a></h3>
<p>Based on the workload and the defined frequency scaling policies, the system makes
decisions on whether to increase or decrease the CPU clock speed. If the CPU utilization
is low and the workload is light, the system may decrease the clock speed to conserve
power. Conversely, if the CPU utilization is high and demanding tasks are running, the system may increase the clock speed to ensure optimal performance.</p>
<h3 id="clock-speed-adjustment"><a class="header" href="#clock-speed-adjustment">Clock Speed Adjustment</a></h3>
<p>Once the scaling decision is made, Violet adjusts the CPU clock speed accordingly. This
adjustment is achieved by modifying the voltage and frequency settings of the CPU.
Lowering the clock speed reduces the number of clock cycles per second, resulting in
lower power consumption. Increasing the clock speed provides more processing power for
resource-intensive tasks but may consume more power.</p>

<h2 id="program-executions"><a class="header" href="#program-executions">Program executions</a></h2>
<p>Violet does not allow standalone binaries to be executed directly. Instead, all code
execution occurs within the context of the system or an application.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System Code:</strong> This includes the kernel itself and system services.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> These are user-installed applications that run within the Violet environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="permissions"><a class="header" href="#permissions">Permissions</a></h2>
<p>Violet follows a strict permission model to control the capabilities of applications. By
default, applications have limited privileges and require explicit permissions to perform
certain actions.</p>
<p>Permissions are designed to regulate what actions an application can take within the
system. Applications must request and be granted the necessary permissions to access
resources or perform specific operations.</p>
<h2 id="hardware-access"><a class="header" href="#hardware-access">Hardware access</a></h2>
<p>Hardware access in Violet occurs through a two-layered approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel Detection:</strong> The kernel detects and enumerates the connected hardware devices.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Service:</strong> The hardware service acts as an intermediary layer between the system and hardware devices, providing access and management capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-drivers"><a class="header" href="#hardware-drivers">Hardware drivers</a></h2>
<p>Unlike many other operating systems, hardware drivers in Violet are implemented as simple
applications rather than tightly integrated components of the kernel. Applications can
declare themselves as drivers by utilizing the hardware service.</p>
<p>When an application requests hardware access, the system selects the appropriate driver
based on certain criteria. The hardware service facilitates communication between the
system, hardware services, and drivers to perform the requested operations.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-access-performances"><a class="header" href="#hardware-access-performances">Hardware access performances</a></h3>
<p>Hardware accesses are performed through syscalls and signals using CPU interrupts. The
process typically follows these steps:</p>
<p>Hardware accesses are provided via <em>syscall</em> and <em>signals</em> using CPU interrupts.</p>
<p>The access process usually works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A userspace process sends a notification to a system service.</li>
<li>The system service communicates with the corresponding hardware service.</li>
<li>The hardware service contacts the relevant driver associated with the requested hardware.</li>
<li>The driver interacts with the hardware through the hardware service.</li>
<li>The result of the operation is transmitted back through the hardware service, system service, and ultimately to the userspace process.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="filesystem-access"><a class="header" href="#filesystem-access">Filesystem access</a></h2>
<p>Filesystem access in Violet is generally fast, thanks to direct storage access. The
filesystem service handles most operations by directly communicating with the storage
files.</p>
<p>For filesystems that are not natively supported, a filesystem interface is available to
communicate with the storage driver service. Although this process introduces some
additional latency, it remains within an acceptable performance range and is only used in
specific edge cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface"><a class="header" href="#user-interface">User interface</a></h2>
<p>The user interface in Violet is managed by desktop environments, which are services provided by applications. These desktop environments are responsible for rendering the graphical elements, handling input events, and providing a cohesive user experience.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="developer-mode"><a class="header" href="#developer-mode">Developer Mode</a></h1>
<p>The developer mode enables several features that are not
available by default. Only administrator user get access to
them when they are enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/dev-mode.html#developer-mode">Developer Mode</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/dev-mode.html#how-to-enable">How to enable?</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/dev-mode.html#kernel-module-development">Kernel Module Development</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/dev-mode.html#application-proxies">Application proxies</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-enable"><a class="header" href="#how-to-enable">How to enable?</a></h2>
<p>Developer mode can be enabled either by typing the following command
in the terminal:</p>
<p>Developer Mode can be enabled in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the terminal and type following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-sh">vio central --enable dev-mode
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Alternatively, while holding the <code>Ctrl</code> <code>Alt</code> and <code>Shift</code> keys, type <code>DEV</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Developer Mode is enabled, additional features and options become accessible,
providing developers with greater control and flexibility over the system.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-module-development"><a class="header" href="#kernel-module-development">Kernel Module Development</a></h2>
<p>Kernel module development is a powerful capability offered by Violet's Developer
Mode that allows developers to extend the functionality of the operating system at
the kernel level. Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded
and unloaded into the running kernel.</p>
<p>Kernel modules have direct access to various services and resources provided by Sakura,
such as memory management, process scheduling, IPC.</p>
<h2 id="application-proxies"><a class="header" href="#application-proxies">Application proxies</a></h2>
<p>Application proxies collect all calls made by the application to the system.
It is useful for applications debugging.</p>
<p>When a proxy is set up for an application, all system calls sent to this application
will be transferred to the proxy, which will be able to do whatever it wants with it.
It's possible for the proxy to never answer the signal, to change its content before actually sending it to the system, etc.</p>
<p>Basic usage of an application proxy is as a &quot;listener&quot;: it only listens to
specific signals and logs them, without cancelling them and/or modifying them.
This is useful to check all filesystem access requested by an application, in real time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="integrity"><a class="header" href="#integrity">Integrity</a></h1>
<p>Integrity is a crucial aspect of Violet, ensuring the stability, security
and reliability of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/integrity.html#integrity">Integrity</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/integrity.html#system-immutability">System immutability</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/integrity.html#hashes">Hashes</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/integrity.html#checking-hashes">Checking hashes</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-immutability"><a class="header" href="#system-immutability">System immutability</a></h2>
<p>The <code>/sys</code> folder in Violet is designed as immutable, meaning that
it cannot be modified by any user or process, including the main administrator.
This strict immutability ensures the integrity and consistency of system-level
components and configurations. The only exceptions to this immutability rule are the
repair process and system updates initiated by the operating system itself.</p>
<h2 id="hashes"><a class="header" href="#hashes">Hashes</a></h2>
<p>To ensure the integrity of critical files within the <code>/sys</code> and <code>/sys/etc</code> directories,
Violet employs the <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3"><code>BLAKE3</code></a> hashing algorithm.
When these files are written or updated, their contents are hashed, and the resulting
hash values are stored in the system's hash registry, located at <code>/etc/sys/hashes</code>.</p>
<h2 id="checking-hashes"><a class="header" href="#checking-hashes">Checking hashes</a></h2>
<p>During the boot process or when critical files are accessed, Violet performs integrity
checks by recalculating the hashes of the files and comparing them with the values stored
in the hash registry. If the calculated hashes do not match the stored values, it
indicates that the file has been tampered with or corrupted.</p>
<ol>
<li>System (<code>/sys</code>) or System Backup (<code>/sys/backup</code>):
<ul>
<li>If a hash mismatch is detected in a system file, Violet initiates a check of the system backup's integrity.</li>
<li>If the backup is intact, the system will restore itself from the backup.</li>
<li>If the backup is also corrupted, the system will refuse to boot and prompt for reinstallation.</li>
<li>Users' personal documents and data will remain unaffected unless they have been specifically corrupted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hash Registry (<code>/etc/sys/hashes</code>) or Registry (<code>/etc/sys/registry</code>):
<ul>
<li>Similar to the system files, a hash mismatch in the hash registry or system registry triggers a check of the system backup's integrity.</li>
<li>If the backup is valid, the system will restore itself from the backup, preserving the integrity of the hash registry and registry files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crash Save:
<ul>
<li>In the case of crash saves, if a hash mismatch is detected, the corresponding crash save file will not be restored.</li>
<li>This precautionary measure ensures that potentially corrupted crash saves do not compromise the stability or security of the system.</li>
<li>In exceptional cases, users may choose to force the restoration of crash saves, but they are warned about the potential risks and instability it may introduce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sandbox:
<ul>
<li>If a hash mismatch occurs in a sandbox file, the system will refuse to start the sandbox.</li>
<li>This safeguard prevents potential security breaches that could arise from compromised or tampered sandbox environments.</li>
<li>As with crash saves, there is an option to force the startup of the sandbox, but it is accompanied by a warning highlighting the associated risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h2 id="considerations-and-limitations"><a class="header" href="#considerations-and-limitations">Considerations and Limitations</a></h2>
<p>It is important to note that although Violet Calls Wrapper allows running Violet
applications on different platforms, certain limitations and considerations exist:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> Violet Calls Wrapper may not fully replicate Violet's permission management features across all platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Native Violet Apps:</strong> Violet Calls Wrapper provides compatibility for Violet ecosystem programs, but may not provide access to native Violet apps. This means that certain features, such as Violet desktop, may not be accessible when running the apps through the wrapper.</li>
<li><strong>Platform-Specific Limitations:</strong> Each operating system has its own limitations and considerations. While Violet Calls Wrapper aims to provide a seamless experience, it may encounter platform-specific issues or restrictions that may affect the performance or functionality of Violet apps.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pre-compiling"><a class="header" href="#pre-compiling">Pre-compiling</a></h1>
<p>Traditionally, software programs are distributed as binaries specific to a particular
platform, such as Windows, Linux, macOS, and to a particular architecture, such as x86 or
ARM. This can lead to limited availability and compatibility for users on different
systems.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet chis challenge and provide a more stable and secure environment for native programs, Violet offers a approach. In this approach, Violet applications are distributed as Violet Pre-compiled Programs (VPP) using a special low-level language called Rosa</p>
<h2 id="how-does-pre-compilation-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-pre-compilation-work">How Does Pre-Compilation Work?</a></h2>
<p>Rosa represents the foundation of Violet's pre-compilation process. It involves compressing very low-level source files already created on the machine where the application will run.</p>
<h3 id="multi-platform-and-multi-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#multi-platform-and-multi-compatibility">Multi-Platform and Multi-Compatibility</a></h3>
<p>With pre-compilation, Violet apps naturally become multiplatform and can run smoothly on
different operating systems including Windows, Linux, macOS and more.</p>
<h3 id="optimized-apps"><a class="header" href="#optimized-apps">Optimized Apps</a></h3>
<p>Precompiled Violet apps are specifically optimized for the target machine they will run
on. This optimization allows programs to take full advantage of the system's
capabilities, resulting in improved performance and efficiency. By adapting the
application to the target architecture, Violet enables users to get the best possible
performance on their machines.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-build-process"><a class="header" href="#efficient-build-process">Efficient Build Process</a></h3>
<p>Despite advanced optimizations applied during pre-compile, Violet maintains an efficient
build process. VPP files can be compiled quickly, allowing users to install and run
applications without significant delays or long wait times.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-with-non-violet-operating-systems"><a class="header" href="#compatibility-with-non-violet-operating-systems">Compatibility With non-Violet Operating Systems</a></h2>
<p>Being a multiplatform technology, Rosa can also be run on non-Violet operating systems
using a lightweight wrapper provided by Violet. Available for download from Violet's
website, this wrapper allows users to run Violet apps on their preferred platforms, even
if those platforms are not natively supported by Violet.</p>
<p>While Rosa itself is multiplatform, it's important to note that Violet apps take
advantage of the unique and ultra-beautiful features of the Violet ecosystem. As a
result, running these applications on non-Violet operating systems requires installing
the full package provided by Violet. This allows users to fully experience the rich
capabilities and seamless integration that the Violet platform has to offer.</p>
<p>Note: As Violet continues to evolve, updates and improvements may be made available
during the pre-build process and in the Rosa language. Stay connected with the Violet
community and visit the official website for the latest developments and updates.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="io-nano-manager"><a class="header" href="#io-nano-manager">I/O Nano-manager</a></h1>
<p>The Input/Output Nano-manager, also known as <em>Iona</em>, is an integral part of the
Violet system responsible for handling input/output requests from processes. It serves
as the intermediary between processes and the underlying hardware, managing and
coordinating the flow of data between them.</p>
<p>Iona is represented by the <a href="technical/../specs/services/hw.html"><code>sys::hw</code></a> service, which provides a
unified interface for accessing and controlling various hardware devices within the system.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/iona.html#io-nano-manager">I/O Nano-manager</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/iona.html#hardware-access">Hardware Access</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/iona.html#requests-priority">Requests Priority</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-access-1"><a class="header" href="#hardware-access-1">Hardware Access</a></h2>
<p>When a process needs to access hardware resources, such as storage devices or network
interfaces, it sends its request to Iona. Iona acts as the gatekeeper, deciding whether
to grant or deny the requested access based on predefined rules and permissions.</p>
<p>System services, such as <a href="technical/../specs/services/fs.html"><code>sys::fs</code></a> for file system operations or <a href="technical/../specs/services/net.html"><code>sys::net</code></a> for network communication, rely on Iona to
interact with the corresponding hardware devices.</p>
<h3 id="requests-priority"><a class="header" href="#requests-priority">Requests Priority</a></h3>
<p>To ensure efficient resource utilization, Iona handles the requests from processes based
on their priority. The priority of a request is determined either by the arrival
timestamp of the request or the priority assigned to the process making the request.</p>
<p>In this way, Iona can optimize the allocation of hardware resources and give precedence
to higher-priority processes or time-sensitive operations. This prioritization mechanism
helps ensure smooth and responsive I/O operations throughout the system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="devices"><a class="header" href="#devices">Devices</a></h1>
<p>In the Violet system, devices play a crucial role in enabling various functionalities and
interactions. Devices can include hardware components such as cameras, microphones,
storage drives, network adapters, and more. The system manages these devices through the
use of device handler files (DHF) and provides a unified interface for interacting with
them.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connecting-a-new-device"><a class="header" href="#connecting-a-new-device">Connecting a New Device</a></h2>
<p>When a new device is connected to the computer, a corresponding device handler file (DHF)
is created in the <code>/dev</code> directory. The location and organization of DHFs may vary
depending on the type of device. For example, a hard drive may have a DHF path like <code>/dev/sst/b0b4</code>.</p>
<p>The filename is random and unique, in the format <code>[a-z][0-9][a-z][0-9]</code> (lowercase, digit, then lowercase again, and finally another digit).</p>
<h2 id="interacting-with-a-device"><a class="header" href="#interacting-with-a-device">Interacting With a Device</a></h2>
<p>To interact with a device, applications and system services utilize the
<a href="technical/../specs/services/hw.html"><code>sys::hw</code></a> service. The specific actions that can be
performed depend on the type of device:</p>
<p>Different actions may be happen depending on the device's type:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera devices:</strong> when an application asks to capture a photo/video, the device will be suggested to take the images from</li>
<li><strong>Microphones:</strong> when an application asks to capture sound, the device will be suggested to capture the sound from</li>
<li><strong>Sound output devices:</strong> the device will be available for playback</li>
<li><strong>Network adapters:</strong> the device will be available to make network requests on</li>
<li><strong>Other supported wireless devices:</strong> depends on the type (Bluetooth adapter, ...)</li>
<li><strong>Basic/persistent storage devices:</strong> when possible, the device will be automatically mounted in <code>/mnt</code> and visible in the files explorer</li>
</ul>
<p>For uncategorized devices (in <code>/dev/etc</code>), a popup is shown to the user, to indicate
the connected device is not recognized.</p>
<h2 id="device-handler-files-persistance"><a class="header" href="#device-handler-files-persistance">Device Handler Files Persistance</a></h2>
<p>When a device is disconnected, the associated device handler file (DHF) is not
immediately removed. Instead, if a process attempts to interact with the DHF, the
<a href="technical/../specs/services/hw.html"><code>sys::hw</code></a> service indicates that the device is currently not
connected. This allows applications to maintain the device's location and association for
future use.</p>
<p>When the device is connected again, it is associated with the same DHF, ensuring consistency and preserving the device's reference in the system.</p>
<h2 id="custom-device-handler-file-names"><a class="header" href="#custom-device-handler-file-names">Custom Device Handler File Names</a></h2>
<p>Violet provides the flexibility to assign custom names to device handler files (DHF). When a custom name is given, a new DHF file is created and linked to the original DHF
file. This preserves compatibility with applications that rely on the original DHF while
allowing for customized naming conventions.</p>
<p>Both the original DHF and the custom DHF point to the same underlying device, offering
the same functionality and features. However, it's important to note that custom DHFs can
be deleted, which may impact applications relying on them. Caution should be exercised
when deleting custom DHFs.</p>
<p>To distinguish custom DHFs from automatically generated DHFs, custom DHF names must
always be longer than four characters. This helps prevent confusion and ensures proper
identification of DHFs within the system.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="processes"><a class="header" href="#processes">Processes</a></h1>
<p>Violet's processes are designed with similarities to Linux processes while introducing
some additional features. There are different types of processes in Violet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>System Processes:</strong> These processes are created by the system itself and are known as low-level processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Processes:</strong> These processes are created by applications and run within the Violet environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worker Processes:</strong> Worker processes are created by applications to handle specific tasks or operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="technical/processes.html#processes">Processes</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/processes.html#child-processes">Child processes</a></li>
<li><a href="technical/processes.html#threading">Threading</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="child-processes"><a class="header" href="#child-processes">Child processes</a></h2>
<p>In Violet, a process has the ability to create child processes. When a child process is
created, it is essentially a 1:1 copy of the parent process, but with its own unique
process ID (PID). To optimize memory usage, copy-on-write (COW) is employed. This means
that the child process initially shares the same memory pages as the parent process, and
memory allocation only occurs when modifications are made.</p>
<p>Child processes inherit the permissions of their parent process. If the parent process
has certain privileges or permissions, they are passed down to the child process.</p>
<p>When a process exits, all of its child processes are immediately terminated as well.</p>
<h2 id="threading"><a class="header" href="#threading">Threading</a></h2>
<p>Violet supports multithreading, allowing processes to create multiple threads that can
run concurrently within the same address space. Threads enable parallel execution of
different parts of a process, enhancing performance and responsiveness.</p>
<p>All threads within a process share the same address space and memory, which means they
can access and modify the same data. Similar to processes, copy-on-write is employed to
optimize memory usage. Memory pages are shared among threads until modifications are made.</p>
<p>Each thread has its own stack, which provides a local execution context for
thread-specific operations.</p>
<p>Threads form a hierarchy within a process, where a parent thread can create child
threads. When a thread exits, all of its child threads are immediately terminated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="services-1"><a class="header" href="#services-1">Services</a></h1>
<p>In Violet, a <em>service</em> is a process that launches at startup and performs specific tasks or provides functionality to the system or applications. Services can be categorized into two types: <em>system services</em> and <em>application services</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="technical/services.html#services">Services</a>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-services"><a class="header" href="#system-services">System services</a></h2>
<p>System services are native applications that are an integral part of the Violet operating
system. These services have system privileges, allowing them to perform various tasks and
interact with the system at a deep level. They are responsible for managing critical
system functionalities and providing essential services to other processes.</p>
<p>They are designed to handle specific actions and functions without directly engaging the
kernel. They have the necessary permissions and access to system resources to perform
their tasks effectively. These services are typically launched at system startup and run
in the background, ensuring the smooth operation of the operating system.</p>
<p>Check <a href="technical/../specs/services/README.html">this document</a> for further details.</p>
<h2 id="application-services"><a class="header" href="#application-services">Application services</a></h2>
<p>Application services, also known as <em>userspace services</em>, are services provided by
applications themselves. These services extend the functionality of applications and
allow them to provide specific features or interact with other parts of the system.
Application services are typically created and managed by application developers and are
specific to their respective applications.</p>
<p>Application services can be accessed and utilized by other applications or system
components through well-defined APIs or communication mechanisms. These services enable
inter-application communication, data sharing, and collaboration, making it possible to
build complex and integrated software ecosystems on top of Violet.</p>
<p>Examples of application services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A messaging application providing a service for sending and receiving messages.</li>
<li>A media player application offering a service for playing audio and video files.</li>
<li>A document editor providing a service for creating and editing documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging application services, developers can build rich and interconnected
applications that leverage the capabilities of Violet and provide seamless user
experiences.</p>

<p>This document describes the structure, features and behaviours
to both <a href="specs/../concepts/applications.html">applications</a> and
<a href="specs/../concepts/libraries.html">libraries</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="specs/apps-and-libraries.html#applications-and-libraries">Applications and libraries</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="specs/apps-and-libraries.html#name-and-slug">Name and slug</a></li>

<li><a href="specs/apps-and-libraries.html#manifest">Manifest</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="name-and-slug"><a class="header" href="#name-and-slug">Name and slug</a></h2>
<p>Each application has a name as well as a slug. The name can any valid UTF-8 string, while the slug must respect several rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only lowercase letters, underscores and digits</li>
<li>Must not start by a digit</li>
<li>Must not be the name of a native shell command</li>
<li>Must not be the name of a native shell function</li>
<li>Must not be the name of a shell type</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the slug is auto-generated from the name, but it can also be customized.</p>
<h2 id="application-identifier"><a class="header" href="#application-identifier">Application identifier</a></h2>
<p>The <em>Application identifier</em> (AID) is created using the slug and the developer's identifier (DID).</p>
<p>For example, an application with slug of <code>app</code> made by a developer
whose DID is <code>gulje</code> will get an AID of <code>gulje::app</code>.</p>
<p>The AID is unique across the store as well as in a single Violet installation.
As malicious application may provide the DID and the slug of a legit application
(<em>AID spoofing</em>), sideloading is verified by default.</p>
<p>System applications are registered under the reserved <code>sys</code> DID.</p>
<h2 id="features-1"><a class="header" href="#features-1">Features</a></h2>
<p>Applications and libraries can define features that are optional parts in the application.
They are described in the manifest and can be enabled or disabled when installing
a program.</p>
<p>Each feature allows to embed additional assets and declare additional supported
languages and a specific build option.</p>
<p>This allows to save space and build time when a specific feature isn't required,
but should still embedded in the program itself instead of making an additional
application or library.</p>
<p>When the manifest declares one or more feature(s), it must also specify
a set of default features to enable.</p>

<h2 id="application-package"><a class="header" href="#application-package">Application package</a></h2>
<p>Application packages are files that have either the
<code>*.vap</code> (Violet Application Package) or
<code>*.vva</code> (Violet Volatile Application).</p>
<h3 id="content"><a class="header" href="#content">Content</a></h3>
<p>VAP and VVA files are ZStandard archives that contain <code>manifest.toml</code>
describing the archive and <code>hash.md5</code> file that confirm that the archive
is not corrupted.</p>
<h3 id="pre-compiled-applications"><a class="header" href="#pre-compiled-applications">Pre-compiled applications</a></h3>
<p>By default, the system tries to install
<a href="specs/../technical/pre-compiling.html">pre-compiled programs</a> from
the application's package if possible.</p>
<h3 id="embedding-libraries"><a class="header" href="#embedding-libraries">Embedding libraries</a></h3>
<p>Although it's a better practice to split applications and libraries
into different packages, sometimes it's more easy to embed both in
the same package, especially in two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the application is just a thin layer ahead of the library (e.g. CLI tool)</li>
<li>When the library's API changes rapidly and the application relies on it</li>
</ul>
<p>For such scenarios, it's possible for an application package to embed one or more libraries, and publish them all at once.</p>
<h3 id="values-encoding"><a class="header" href="#values-encoding">Values encoding</a></h3>
<p>The application's startup arguments and output value use the following encoding:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Type code</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Representation</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>0x00</code></td><td><code>void</code></td><td>-</td><td>nothing</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>0x01</code></td><td><code>bool</code></td><td>boolean</td><td>1 byte, <code>0x00</code> = false, <code>0x01</code> = true</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>0x02</code></td><td><code>int</code></td><td>64-bit signed integer number</td><td>-</td></tr>

</div>
<h3 id="returning-and-failing"><a class="header" href="#returning-and-failing">Returning and failing</a></h3>
<p>The value must be returned using the <code>CMDOUT</code> pipe. The data sent through
this pipe must follow the above <a href="specs/applications.html#values-encoding">encoding</a>.</p>
<p>A command may also fail. To incidate so, the process must send the <code>0xFF</code>
value through the pipi.</p>

<p>Violet utilizes the <strong>Btrfs</strong> filesystem as the primary storage system. There are three partitions used for data:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>FAT32 partition for bootloader:</strong> This partition is dedicated to storing the bootloader, which is responsible for booting the operating system.</li>
<li><strong>FAT32 partition for the system (<code>/sys</code> and <code>/etc/sys</code>):</strong> The system partition contains essential system files and configurations that are necessary for the proper functioning of the operating system.</li>
<li><strong>Btrfs partition for user data:</strong> The user data partition is where user-specific files and data are stored. </li>

<p>Permissions are used to control what applications can
do or not.</p>
<h2 id="level-of-permissions"><a class="header" href="#level-of-permissions">Level of permissions</a></h2>
<p>Permissions are divided into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic (<code>B</code>): basic permissions, like window creation, which are granted automatically by default</li>
<li>Implicit (<code>I</code>): ermissions implied by the usage of an application, like opening a file with an application grants it an access while the application is running</li>
<li>Global (<code>G</code>): accessing and modifying non-critical parts of the state of the system, like controlling the global volume or reading</li>
<li>Sensitive (<code>S</code>): accessing sensitive informations, like filesystem or network access</li>
<li>Privacy (<code>P</code>): accessing privacy-related data, like microphone or webcam access</li>
</ul>

<p>Devices are detected during the boot process and then periodically after startup
This allows to hotplug some additional devices afterwards.</p>
<p>Not every device uses the same connection protocol,
detection varies by connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCI-Express devices are detected through their Configuration Space</li>
<li>IDE/SATA devices are detected through the IDE/SATA controller</li>
<li>USB devices are enumerated through the USB protocol stack</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="connection-interface-identifier"><a class="header" href="#connection-interface-identifier">Connection interface identifier</a></h2>
<p>The connection interface identifier (CII) is a 4-byte number describing what a device is connected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection type (1 byte)
<ul>
<li><code>0x01</code>: PCI-Express</li>
<li><code>0x02</code>: IDE</li>
<li><code>0x03</code>: SATA</li>

<p><em>Kernel-process Communication (KPC)</em> is a term that
describes how a process can communicate with Sakura.</p>
<p>There are two types of KPC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="specs/kernel/syscalls.html">System calls</a></li>
<li><a href="specs/kernel/./signals.html">Signals</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="system-calls"><a class="header" href="#system-calls">System calls</a></h1>
<p>System calls (syscalls) are a type of <a href="specs/kernel/./kpc.html">KPC</a>.
They allow a process to ask Sakura to perform
a task.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Syscalls are performed using CPU interruptions to notify Sakura.</p>
<p>System calls always return two numbers: a 8-bit errcode and
8 bytes return value. If the errcode is not null, then an
error occured during the syscall. Certain error codes
indicate certain errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x00</code>: cannot read syscall's code or arguments</li>
<li><code>0x01</code>: syscall does not exists</li>
<li><code>0x02</code>: at least one argument is invalid (e.g. providing a pointer to the <code>0</code> address)</li>
<li><code>0x03</code>: unmapped memory pointer</li>
<li><code>0x04</code>: memory permission error</li>
<li><code>0x10</code> - <code>0x1F</code>: invalid argument(s) provided</li>
<li><code>0x20</code> - <code>0x2F</code>: provided arguments are not valid in the current context (in relation with other arguments)</li>
<li><code>0x30</code> - <code>0x3F</code>: provided arguments are not valid (after resources checking)</li>
<li><code>0x40</code> - <code>0x4F</code>: resource access error</li>
<li><code>0x50</code> - <code>0x5F</code>: hardware errors</li>
<li><code>0x60</code> - <code>0x6F</code>: other types of errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The codes of system calls are also categorized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x00</code> - <code>0x0F</code>: signal handling</li>
<li><code>0x10</code> - <code>0x1F</code>: process management</li>

<p><em>Signals</em> are a type of <a href="specs/kernel/./kpc.html">KPC</a>.
They are used by Sakura to send information.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h2>
<p>When a process is created, Sakura associates it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signals handler table (SHT)</li>
<li>Signals queue</li>
<li>Readiness indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>Each signal has an 8-bit code to represent it.
Also, a 32 bytes data field is added to give additional
information about the signal.</p>
<p>When Sakura sends a signal to a process, it first checks
if a handler is running. If so, it puts the signal in the queue.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it reads the readiness indicator. If <code>false</code>, the signal is queued.</p>
<p>If this is not the case, it checks whether the signal has a handler in the SHT.
If the handler is not present, depending on the particular signals, it may be
ignored or a default behavior may be used.</p>
<p>If the handler is found, Sakura checks whether the memory area pointed as
the address of the handler can be run by the current process.
If not, the signal is converted to the HANDLER_FAULT signal.</p>
<p>Sakura then switches the process to its main thread and makes it jump
to the handler's address, then resumes it.</p>
<p>When the handler returns, if the signal is waiting for a response,
Sakura reads it from a specific register and does what needs to be done.
If it is, the kernel simply makes the process jump back to the address it
was to before the signal was emitted, and switch to the original thread.</p>
