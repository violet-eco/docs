Violet's Mood Detection feature allows you to engage emotionally with your device on a whole new level. Violet interprets your mood by analyzing your facial expressions and vocal clues in real time using powerful machine learning algorithms.

AI is the secret sauce that adds that spark to Violet!

### User Behaviour Analytics
